# ENG-220-MATLAB-PROJECTS
For Part A of the Matlab project, we would take the portion of the excel file to save it as a normal workspace file to run for part B of the project. It also teaches the user the concept of displaying information in the command window like with the excel file it would explain the collumns and rows of the workspace file. The last command would display text in the command window of whatever was inserted in the quotation mark.
Part B of the project was very insightful, it took data from the workspace file of data imported from the excel file and would run all types of information based on the class scores like the class average, the grade average, individual scores etc.
To mofidy the code for B, we would take any portion of text in the code titled, "col11" and switch it to read "col1" to only take the last column of the code. After rerunning the code again, we would get different results for the graphs showing only the final grade average, and final class average.
